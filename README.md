# Cardiovascular Disease Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of a dataset related to cardiovascular disease. The dataset consists of health-related information, including demographic details, medical measurements, and lifestyle factors of individuals. The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease and to build a predictive model for disease classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises two tables:

1. **caardio_alco**: This table contains information about alcohol consumption, including an 'alco' column indicating alcohol consumption status. The 'id' column is used as a unique identifier.

2. **caardio_base**: This table contains a broader range of health-related attributes, including age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure measurements (ap_hi and ap_lo), cholesterol level, and smoking status. It also includes the 'id' column as a unique identifier.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The initial phase of the project involves data cleaning and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, addressing outliers, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will conduct EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, correlations, and potential factors associated with cardiovascular disease.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, or encoding categorical variables to improve model performance and provide meaningful insights.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: We will perform hypothesis tests to validate or reject specific hypotheses related to cardiovascular risk factors.


## Tools and Libraries

This project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis or explore the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided to access the code and execute the analysis.
